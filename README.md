Level 1 Practice Programs

1----
Write a program to compare two strings using the charAt() method and check the result with the built-in String equals() method
Hint => 
Take user input using the  Scanner next() method for 2 String variables
Write a method to compare two strings using the charAt() method and return a boolean result
Use the String Built-In method to check if the results are the same and display the result 

2----
Write a program to create a substring from a String using the charAt() method. Also, use the String built-in method substring() to find the substring of the text. Finally Compare the the two strings and display the results
Hint => 
Take user input using the  Scanner next() method to take the String variable and also the start and the end index to get the substring from the given text
Write a method to create a substring from a string using the charAt() method with the string, start, and end index as the parameters
Write a method to compare two strings using the charAt() method and return a boolean result
Use the String built-in method substring() to get the substring and compare the two strings. And finally display the result


3---
Write a program to return all the characters in a string using the user-defined method,  compare the result with the String built-in toCharArray() method, and display the result
Hint => 
Take user input using the  Scanner next() method to take the text into a String variable
Write a method to return the characters in a string without using the toCharArray() 
Write a method to compare two string arrays and return a boolean result
In the main() call the user-defined method and the String built-in ​​toCharArray() method, compare the 2 arrays, and finally display the result



4---
Write a program to demonstrate NullPointerException. 
Hint => 
Write a Method to generate the Exception. Here define the variable text and initialize it to null. Then call one of the String Method to generate the exception
Write the Method to demonstrate NullPointerException. Here define the variable text and initialize it to null. Then write try catch block for handling the Exception while accessing one of the String method
From the main Firstly call the method to generate the Exception then refactor the code to call the method to handle the RuntimeException



5---
Write a program to demonstrate StringIndexOutOfBoundsException
Hint => 
Define a variable of type String and take user input to assign a value
Write a Method to generate the Exception. Access the index using charAt() beyond the length of the String. This will generate a runtime exception and abruptly stop the program.
Write the Method to demonstrate StringIndexOutOfBoundsException. Access the index using charAt() beyond the length of the String. Then write try catch block for Exception while accessing the String method
From the main Firstly call the method to generate the Exception then call the method to handle the RuntimeException



6---
Write a program to demonstrate IllegalArgumentException
Hint => 
Define a variable of type String and take user input to assign a value
Write a Method to generate the Exception. Here use the subString() and set the start index to be greater than the end index. This will generate a runtime exception and abruptly stop the program. 
Write the Method to demonstrate IllegalArgumentException. Here use the subString() and set the start index to be greater than the end index. This will generate a runtime exception. Use the try-catch block to handle the IllegalArgumentException and the generic runtime exception
From the main Firstly call the method to generate the Exception then call the method to handle the RuntimeException



7---
Write a program to demonstrate NumberFormatException
Hint => 
Define a variable to take user input as a String 
Use Integer.parseInt() to generate this exception. Integer.parseInt() is a built-in function in java.lang.Integer class to extract the number from text. In case the text does not contain numbers the method will throw NumberFormatException which is a runtime exception
Write a Method to generate the Exception. Use Integer.parseInt(text) to extract number from the text. This will generate a runtime exception and abruptly stop the program. 
Write the Method to demonstrate NumberFormatException. Use Integer.parseInt(text) to extract number from the text. This will generate a runtime exception. Use the try-catch block to handle the NumberFormatException as well as the generic runtime exception
From the main Firstly call the method to generate the Exception then call the method to handle the RuntimeException



8---
Write a program to demonstrate ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
Hint => 
Define a variable of array of names and take input from the user
Write a Method to generate the Exception. Here access index larger then the length of the array. This will generate a runtime exception and abruptly stop the program. 
Write the Method to demonstrate ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. Here access index larger then the length of the array. This will generate a runtime exception. Use the try-catch block to handle the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException and the generic runtime exception
From the main Firstly call the method to generate the Exception then call the method to handle the RuntimeException




9---
Write a program to convert the complete text to uppercase and compare the results
Hint => 
Take user input using the  Scanner nextLine() method to take the complete text into a String variable
Write a method using the String built-in charAt() method to convert each character if it is lowercase to the uppercase. Use the logic ASCII value of 'a' is 97 and 'A' is 65 so the difference is 32, similarly ASCII value of 'b' is 98 and 'B' is 66 so the difference is 32, and so on
Write a method to compare two strings using the charAt() method and return a boolean result
In the main() use the String built-in method toUpperCase() to get the uppercase text and compare the two strings using the user-defined method. And finally display the result




10---
result
Write a program to convert the complete text to lowercase and compare the results
Hint => 
Take user input using the  Scanner nextLine() method to take the complete text into a String variable
Write a method using the String built-in charAt() method to convert each character if it is uppercase to the lowercase. Use the logic ASCII value of 'a' is 97 and 'A' is 65 so the difference is 32, similarly ASCII value of 'b' is 98 and 'B' is 66 so the difference is 32, and so on
Write a method to compare two strings using the charAt() method and return a boolean result
In the main() use the String built-in method toLowerCase() to get the lowercase text and compare the two strings using the user-defined method. And finally display the result
